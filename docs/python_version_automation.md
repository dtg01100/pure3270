# Python Version Automation in Pure3270

## Overview

Pure3270 includes comprehensive automation for testing and maintaining compatibility across multiple Python versions. This documentation explains the automated systems in place to ensure the library works correctly across all supported Python versions (3.10-3.13).

## Automated Testing Matrix

Pure3270 is automatically tested on all supported Python versions using GitHub Actions:

- Python 3.10
- Python 3.11
- Python 3.10
- Python 3.11
- Python 3.12
- Python 3.13

### CI Workflows

The project uses two main CI workflows:

1. **Full CI** (`ci.yml`): Runs comprehensive tests on pushes and pull requests to main/develop branches
2. **Quick CI** (`quick-ci.yml`): Runs essential tests on pushes and pull requests to feature branches

Both workflows test across all supported Python versions to ensure compatibility.

## Version-Specific Testing

Pure3270 includes version-specific tests to verify behavior that may differ across Python versions:

### Test File Location

Version-specific tests are included in the general test suite with conditional execution based on Python version.

### Test Categories

1. **Language Feature Tests**: Verify Python version-specific language features
2. **Asyncio Behavior Tests**: Check asyncio behavior differences across versions
3. **SSL/TLS Handling Tests**: Validate SSL handling across Python versions
4. **String/Bytes Handling Tests**: Ensure consistent string/bytes operations

### Conditional Test Execution

Tests use decorators to conditionally execute based on Python version:

```python
# Example of conditional test execution (actual implementation in tests/):
# @pytest.mark.skipif(sys.version_info < (3, 10), reason="Requires Python 3.10+")
# def test_match_statement():
#     # Test code here
```

## Automated Release Integration

The project includes automated systems for integrating new Python releases:

### Release Detection Script

A script (`scripts/check_python_releases.py`) periodically checks for new Python releases and can automatically update the test matrix.

### New Version Integration Process

1. New Python versions are automatically detected
2. CI workflows are updated to include new versions
3. Canary testing is performed on pre-release versions
4. Issues are automatically created for compatibility problems

## Performance Monitoring

Performance is monitored across Python versions to detect regressions:

### Benchmark Tests

Performance benchmarks are implemented using `pytest-benchmark` to track execution times across Python versions.

### Performance Dashboard

A dashboard (`dashboard/index.html`) visualizes performance metrics across Python versions.

## Compatibility Validation

The library includes runtime validation to ensure compatibility:

### Version Checking

At import time, the library checks the Python version and provides appropriate warnings or errors for unsupported versions.

### Runtime Compatibility

Version-specific code paths handle differences in behavior across Python versions.

## Dashboard and Reporting

### Compatibility Dashboard

A web-based dashboard provides real-time status of compatibility across Python versions.

### Historical Data

Test results are stored and visualized to show trends over time.

## Best Practices for Development

### Adding New Features

When adding new features, consider:

1. Python version compatibility
2. Need for version-specific implementations
3. Performance implications across versions

### Writing Tests

When writing tests, consider:

1. Using version-specific decorators when appropriate
2. Testing edge cases that may differ across versions
3. Verifying performance characteristics

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks

1. **Weekly**: Check for new Python releases
2. **Monthly**: Review compatibility dashboard
3. **Quarterly**: Update dependency compatibility matrix

### Updating the Test Matrix

To update the Python versions tested:

1. Modify the `strategy.matrix.python-version` in CI workflow files
2. Update version-specific tests as needed
3. Verify all tests pass on new versions

## Troubleshooting

### Test Failures on Specific Versions

If tests fail on specific Python versions:

1. Check version-specific test cases
2. Review Python documentation for version-specific changes
3. Implement version-specific code paths if necessary

### Performance Regressions

If performance regresses on specific versions:

1. Check the performance dashboard
2. Run benchmarks to identify specific operations
3. Investigate Python version-specific performance changes

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements to the Python version automation system:

1. Automated issue creation for failing new Python versions
2. Enhanced performance regression detection
3. Expanded version-specific test coverage
4. Integration with continuous fuzzing services
