Welcome to Pure3270's documentation!
====================================

Pure3270 is a self-contained, pure Python 3.9+ implementation of a 3270 terminal
emulator, designed to emulate the functionality of the ``s3270`` terminal
emulator. It integrates seamlessly with the ``p3270`` library through runtime
monkey-patching, allowing you to replace ``p3270``'s dependency on the external
``s3270`` binary without complex setup.
