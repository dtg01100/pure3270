Welcome to Pure3270's documentation!
====================================

Pure3270 is a self-contained, pure Python 3.10+ implementation of a 3270 terminal
emulator, designed to emulate the functionality of the ``s3270`` terminal
emulator. It includes a ``P3270Client`` class that implements a superset of the
``p3270`` library API natively, providing 100% drop-in compatibility without
external dependencies.
