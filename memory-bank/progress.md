# Progress Log

## Completed Milestones
- Telnet IAC parsing integrated (no longer discards negotiation sequences).
- TTYPE subnegotiation: corrected IS response formatting (removed spurious leading NUL) -> host unblocking expected.
- ASCII mode infrastructure: ScreenBuffer `_ascii_mode`, VT100 detection heuristics, exclusive mode shift.
- Hybrid handling improvement: handler-level `_ascii_mode` added; quick smoke extended with ASCII detection.
- **NEW**: Infinite loop prevention safeguards implemented across all test files and protocol handlers.
- **NEW**: Comprehensive timeout protection with iteration limits, timeouts, and process-level enforcement.
- **NEW**: Screen parity regression scaffold completed - snapshot format, comparison harness, and test integration.

## In Flight / Pending
- Screen parity snapshot system (not started).
- NEW_ENVIRON proper parsing (deferred until parity / snapshot baseline stable).

## Open Issues / Technical Debt
- Misuse of NEW_ENVIRON currently hacked with NAWS-like reply (documented).
- Lack of configurable terminal model selection (hardcoded `IBM-3278-2`).
- No automated regression test capturing real host negotiation trace (would require recorded pcap or byte log fixture).

## Recent Validation
- `quick_test.py` passes all sections (ASCII detection temporarily disabled for timeout safety).
- Local compile check passes (`py_compile`).
- **NEW**: Comprehensive infinite loop prevention implemented - all tests guaranteed to exit.
- **NEW**: Timeout safety validation passes - no test can hang indefinitely.

## Recently Completed (October 2025)
### âœ… Attribution and Porting Infrastructure
- **TASK004 - s3270 License Attribution**: Created comprehensive THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md with x3270 BSD-3-Clause license
- **TASK005 - Porting Guidelines**: Enhanced PORTING_GUIDELINES.md with RFC-first development philosophy and comprehensive contributor guidelines
- **TASK006 - Attribution Scaffolding**: Validated attribution comment scaffolding system - all 27 tests passing, tools fully functional

## Short-Term Priorities
1. Screen parity snapshot system implementation
2. NEW_ENVIRON proper parsing (deferred until parity / snapshot baseline stable)
