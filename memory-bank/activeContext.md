# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The primary focus is on planning comprehensive enhancements to Pure3270 to improve bug prevention, code quality, testing infrastructure, and Python version compatibility automation. This includes developing detailed implementation plans for each enhancement area while maintaining the library's core mission as a drop-in replacement for p3270's s3270 dependency.

## Recent Changes
- Completed comprehensive planning for bug prevention infrastructure enhancements
- Created detailed implementation plans for Python version automation systems
- Designed AI-assisted development workflows with Copilot integration
- Developed comprehensive testing matrix across Python versions
- Established implementation roadmaps with clear timelines and success metrics

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Balancing modern internal development (Python 3.8+) with external p3270 compatibility requirements
- Leveraging AI assistance for rapid issue analysis and resolution while maintaining code quality
- Implementing proactive compatibility management for new Python releases
- Ensuring comprehensive testing coverage without impacting performance
- Maintaining zero runtime dependencies while adding sophisticated tooling

## Next Steps
1. Begin implementation of enhanced exception handling with contextual information
2. Integrate static analysis tools (mypy, bandit, pylint) with CI/CD workflows
3. Implement property-based testing with Hypothesis framework
4. Set up pre-commit hooks for quality checks
5. Generate API documentation with Sphinx
6. Implement structured logging with JSON formatting
7. Create automated Python version regression detection workflows
8. Implement Copilot-assisted regression analysis systems
9. Establish comprehensive cross-version testing matrix

## Immediate Priorities
- Update progress.md with current planning status
- Create new task files for each planned enhancement area
- Update task index with new enhancement tasks
- Document implementation approach in systemPatterns.md if needed
- Create detailed technical specifications for each enhancement
