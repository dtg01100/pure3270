# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The primary focus is resolving test failures and linting errors to achieve a stable, fully functional pure3270 library. This includes completing the DataStreamParser implementation, fixing test mocks, and ensuring all unit tests pass.

## Recent Changes
- Implemented VT100 sequence detection in TN3270Handler
- Fixed DataStreamParser parse method for various data types (NVT_DATA, SSCP_LU_DATA, PRINT_EOJ)
- Added missing imports for SNA_RESPONSE and PRINTER_STATUS_DATA_TYPE
- Updated test mocks for negotiation and session tests
- Implemented cursor_select and sys_req methods in AsyncSession
- Fixed structured field handling for BIND-IMAGE in DataStreamParser
- Added handle_bind_image method in Negotiator

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Prioritizing RFC compliance over backward compatibility with non-standard implementations
- Using Python standard library only to maintain zero runtime dependencies
- Implementing comprehensive error handling and logging for debugging
- Ensuring async/sync API consistency across Session classes

## Next Steps
1. Fix remaining lint errors in DataStreamParser (indentation, missing arguments)
2. Implement missing handler methods (_handle_eoa, _handle_aid, etc.)
3. Resolve test assertion failures (regex patterns, mock expectations)
4. Complete BIND-IMAGE parsing and structured field support
5. Validate all tests pass with proper coverage
6. Update memory bank with the latest status and commit current WIP branch
7. Run full test suite and iterate on any remaining failures

## Immediate Priorities
- Correct syntax errors preventing code execution
- Implement stub methods to prevent AttributeError
- Update test expectations to match current implementation
- Ensure code formatting and linting compliance
 - Commit WIP branch and push to remote (after lint/tests pass locally)
