# TASK021: Enhanced Exception Handling

## Objective
Implement contextual exception handling that provides detailed information about the state of the session, protocol negotiation, screen buffer, and recent operations when errors occur.

## Scope
- Enhanced base exception classes with context capture
- Automatic state dumping on exceptions (screen content, recent data streams, negotiation state)
- Protocol-specific error contexts (negotiation failures, parse errors, timeout details)
- Macro execution error contexts (current command, variables, screen state)
- Integration with structured logging for error reporting

## Implementation Steps
1. Extend existing exception classes with context attributes
2. Create exception context manager for session operations
3. Implement automatic state capture on error (screen buffer, handler state, recent I/O)
4. Add protocol-specific error details (parse position, invalid bytes, negotiation sequence)
5. Enhance macro errors with execution trace and variable state
6. Integrate with logging system for structured error reports
7. Add unit tests for exception raising and context validation
8. Update documentation with new exception types and handling patterns

## Success Criteria
- All major exception paths include contextual information
- Context capture doesn't impact performance (>95% of normal speed)
- Test coverage for exception scenarios >90%
- Structured error logs contain actionable diagnostic information
- No regressions in existing functionality

## Dependencies
- Structured logging implementation (TASK017)
- Enhanced session state management

## Timeline
- Week 1: Base exception enhancement and context manager
- Week 2: Protocol and macro-specific error contexts
- Week 3: Integration, testing, and documentation
