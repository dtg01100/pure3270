# TASK004 - Integrate s3270 license attribution

**Status:** Completed
**Added:** 2025-10-12
**Updated:** 2025-10-12

## Original Request
Integrate s3270 license attribution - Add THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md and ensure proper attribution comments are present in source code for s3270-derived functionality.

## Thought Process
Pure3270 is heavily inspired by and compatible with IBM s3270/x3270. While THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md exists with comprehensive attribution information, the source code files need proper attribution comments to clearly indicate which parts are derived from or inspired by s3270. This is important for legal compliance and transparency.

The attribution scaffolding system exists (tools/generate_attribution.py) but hasn't been applied to the codebase yet. This task involves:
- Identifying files that contain s3270-derived code
- Adding appropriate attribution comments using the scaffolding system
- Ensuring attribution comments follow the established format
- Validating that attribution requirements are met

## Implementation Plan
1. Identify key files requiring s3270 attribution (protocol, emulation, session management)
2. Use attribution generator tool to create proper comments
3. Add attribution comments to source files
4. Validate attribution compliance
5. Update documentation as needed

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%

## Progress Log
### 2025-10-12
- Created task tracking file
- Identified that THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md exists but attribution comments missing from source code
- Attribution scaffolding system exists but not yet applied to codebase
- Starting attribution integration work
- Added comprehensive attribution comments to:
  - tn3270_handler.py - TN3270/TN3270E protocol implementation
  - negotiator.py - Telnet/TN3270E negotiation logic
  - data_stream.py - 3270 data stream parsing and SNA responses
  - screen_buffer.py - Screen buffer management with EBCDIC support
  - ebcdic.py - EBCDIC â†” ASCII translation (IBM CP037)
  - session.py - Session management and p3270 compatibility
  - p3270_client.py - Drop-in replacement for p3270.P3270Client
- All attribution comments include source reference, license, description, compatibility notes, modifications, integration points, and RFC references where applicable
- Task completed successfully
