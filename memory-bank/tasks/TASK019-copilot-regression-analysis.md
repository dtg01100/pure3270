# TASK019: Copilot-Assisted Regression Analysis

## Objective
Integrate GitHub Copilot for automated analysis of test failures and regressions.

## Requirements
- Use Copilot CLI or API in workflows for code suggestions on failures.
- Generate reports with fix proposals.
- Label issues with copilot suggestions.

## Implementation Steps
1. Update workflows (e.g., python-regression.yml) to invoke Copilot on failures.
2. Create script to parse test output and prompt Copilot for fixes.
3. Add comments to issues with suggested code changes.
4. Test on historical failures.
5. Document integration in COPILOT_WORKFLOW_TESTING.md.

## Success Metrics
- 50% of regressions auto-analyzed with suggestions.
- Reduces manual debugging time.
- Accurate fix proposals validated.

## Dependencies
- Python version automation (TASK018)
