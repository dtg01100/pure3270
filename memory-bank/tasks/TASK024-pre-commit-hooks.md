# TASK024: Pre-Commit Hooks

## Objective
Set up comprehensive pre-commit hooks to enforce code quality, formatting, and security checks before code is committed, reducing CI burden and maintaining consistent codebase standards.

## Scope
- Hook configuration for Python ecosystem tools
- Integration with existing static analysis tools
- Git hooks for commit-time validation
- Custom hooks for 3270-specific checks (EBCDIC validation, protocol constants)
- Performance optimization for fast local execution
- Documentation and onboarding for contributors
- CI validation of hook configurations

## Implementation Steps
1. Install pre-commit framework and configure .pre-commit-config.yaml
2. Add hooks for ruff (linting/formatting), mypy (type checking), bandit (security)
3. Create custom hooks for protocol-specific validations
4. Set up automatic hook installation for new contributors
5. Optimize hook execution order and parallelization
6. Integrate with GitHub workflows for verification
7. Document hook setup and bypass procedures
8. Test hooks across different development environments

## Success Criteria
- All commits pass pre-commit checks locally
- Hook execution <30 seconds on average
- Zero security/linting issues reach CI
- Clear contributor documentation
- Hooks run successfully in all supported Python versions
- Custom 3270-specific validations functional

## Dependencies
- Static analysis tools (TASK022)
- Documentation generation (TASK016)

## Timeline
- Week 1: Basic hook setup and integration
- Week 2: Custom hooks and optimization
- Week 3: Testing, documentation, and CI integration
