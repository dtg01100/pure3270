# TASK028: Copilot Regression Analysis

## Objective
Implement AI-assisted regression analysis using GitHub Copilot and custom workflows to automatically analyze test failures, suggest fixes, and generate pull requests for compatibility issues.

## Scope
- Copilot integration with test failure analysis
- Automated issue creation with failure reproduction
- AI-generated fix suggestions and code patches
- Pull request automation for verified fixes
- Regression test suite maintenance
- Performance monitoring of AI suggestions
- Human review workflows for AI-generated code
- Documentation of AI-assisted development patterns

## Implementation Steps
1. Set up Copilot workspace integration with repository
2. Create workflows for test failure analysis and reproduction
3. Develop AI prompt templates for regression diagnosis
4. Implement automated issue creation with context
5. Add AI code generation for fix suggestions
6. Set up PR automation with verification tests
7. Create human review and approval workflows
8. Monitor AI suggestion accuracy and performance
9. Document AI-assisted development guidelines
10. Integrate with existing regression detection systems

## Success Criteria
- >80% of simple regressions auto-diagnosed
- AI suggestions accepted in >70% of cases
- PR creation time reduced by 50%
- Zero AI-generated security vulnerabilities
- Clear audit trail for AI-assisted changes
- Integration with human review processes
- Measurable reduction in manual debugging time

## Dependencies
- Python version automation (TASK027)
- Copilot workflow testing (TASK019)

## Timeline
- Week 1: Copilot integration and failure analysis
- Week 2: Automated issue/PR workflows
- Week 3: Review processes, monitoring, and documentation
