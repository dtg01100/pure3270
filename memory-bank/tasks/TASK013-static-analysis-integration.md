# TASK013: Integrate Static Analysis Tools

## Objective
Integrate mypy, bandit, pylint into CI/CD workflows for code quality enforcement.

## Requirements
- Run tools on PRs and pushes via GitHub Actions.
- Fail builds on critical issues; warn on style.
- Configure tool-specific rules in .mypy.ini, .pylintrc, .bandit.

## Implementation Steps
1. Update .github/workflows/static-analysis.yml with mypy, pylint, bandit steps.
2. Create config files: mypy.ini, .pylintrc, .bandit in project root.
3. Add pre-commit hooks for local runs (TASK015).
4. Test workflow on sample code changes.
5. Document setup in README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md.

## Success Metrics
- CI runs tools without false positives on main branch.
- Coverage: 100% of Python files analyzed.
- Issue detection rate improves by 20%.

## Dependencies
- Pre-commit hooks (TASK015)
