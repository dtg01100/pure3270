# TASK027: Python Version Automation

## Objective
Create automated systems to detect, test, and maintain compatibility across Python versions, including proactive monitoring of new releases and regression detection.

## Scope
- Automated Python release monitoring and notification
- Dynamic testing matrix generation across supported versions
- Compatibility regression detection workflows
- Automated dependency compatibility testing
- Version-specific configuration management
- Release compatibility reporting
- Integration with CI/CD for multi-version testing
- Documentation of compatibility policies and procedures

## Implementation Steps
1. Set up Python release monitoring (PyPI API, GitHub releases)
2. Create dynamic testing matrix based on supported versions
3. Implement compatibility regression detection (diff-based testing)
4. Add automated dependency compatibility checks
5. Develop version-specific configuration system
6. Create compatibility reporting dashboard/metrics
7. Integrate with existing CI workflows (matrix testing)
8. Set up notification systems for compatibility issues
9. Document compatibility maintenance procedures
10. Test automation across all supported Python versions

## Success Criteria
- Automatic detection of new Python releases within 24 hours
- 100% test coverage across all supported versions
- Regression detection accuracy >95%
- Automated compatibility reports generated weekly
- Zero undetected compatibility regressions
- Clear compatibility policy documentation
- Multi-version testing completes <30 minutes in CI

## Dependencies
- Cross-version testing matrix (TASK020)
- CI/CD enhancements

## Timeline
- Week 1: Release monitoring and testing matrix
- Week 2: Regression detection and reporting
- Week 3: Integration, notifications, and documentation
