# TASK005 - Create porting guidelines document

**Status:** Completed
**Added:** 2025-10-13
**Updated:** 2025-10-13

## Original Request
Create porting guidelines document - PORTING_GUIDELINES.md with rules

## Thought Process
The project needs clear guidelines for contributors who want to port code from third-party sources, especially from x3270/s3270. These guidelines should emphasize RFC compliance over literal copying and provide clear rules for attribution, license compatibility, and integration patterns.

Key requirements:
- Emphasize RFC alignment over literal copy
- Clear attribution requirements
- License compatibility matrix
- Integration patterns for Pure3270
- Process for validating ports
- Quality standards for ported code

## Implementation Plan
1. Create PORTING_GUIDELINES.md document
2. Define porting principles (RFC-first approach)
3. Document license compatibility requirements
4. Provide attribution workflow
5. Include integration guidelines
6. Add validation requirements
7. Provide examples and templates

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%
