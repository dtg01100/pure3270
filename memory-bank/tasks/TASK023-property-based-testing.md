# TASK023: Property-Based Testing

## Objective
Implement property-based testing using Hypothesis to generate comprehensive test cases for protocol parsing, screen buffer operations, and macro execution, ensuring robustness against edge cases.

## Scope
- Hypothesis integration with pytest
- Property tests for data stream parsing (valid/invalid sequences)
- Screen buffer operations (field detection, attribute handling)
- Macro DSL parsing and execution properties
- EBCDIC/ASCII translation round-trip properties
- Network protocol edge cases (partial reads, malformed packets)
- Performance property tests (no regressions under load)
- Test generation strategies for 3270-specific data structures

## Implementation Steps
1. Install Hypothesis and integrate with existing test suite
2. Create property tests for core data structures (Field, ScreenBuffer)
3. Implement parsing property tests (round-trip serialization, error handling)
4. Add macro execution properties (valid syntax, variable substitution)
5. Develop network protocol strategies (telnet sequences, TN3270E headers)
6. Set up test minimization and replay capabilities
7. Integrate with CI for automatic test generation
8. Document property testing approach and strategies

## Success Criteria
- Property tests cover >80% of critical paths
- Fuzzing discovers at least 5 new edge cases
- Test execution time <5 minutes for full suite
- Clear reproduction steps for discovered issues
- Integration with existing unit/integration tests
- No performance degradation from property tests

## Dependencies
- Existing test infrastructure
- Static analysis for type safety in test generation

## Timeline
- Week 1: Hypothesis setup and basic property tests
- Week 2: Protocol and screen buffer properties
- Week 3: Macro and integration properties, CI integration
