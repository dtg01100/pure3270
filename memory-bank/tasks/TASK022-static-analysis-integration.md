# TASK022: Static Analysis Integration

## Objective
Integrate comprehensive static analysis tools into the development workflow and CI/CD pipeline to catch type errors, security vulnerabilities, and code quality issues early.

## Scope
- mypy type checking integration
- Bandit security analysis
- pylint code quality checks
- ruff linting/formatting
- Pre-commit hooks for local validation
- CI workflow updates for automated analysis
- Configuration optimization for 3270 protocol context
- False positive suppression and rule customization

## Implementation Steps
1. Install and configure static analysis tools (mypy, bandit, pylint, ruff)
2. Create configuration files (.mypy.ini, .bandit, .pylintrc, pyproject.toml)
3. Set up pre-commit hooks for local development
4. Update GitHub Actions workflows for CI integration
5. Customize rules for protocol-specific patterns (byte handling, async patterns)
6. Implement baseline reporting and gradual strictness increase
7. Add analysis results to PR checks and issue templates
8. Document analysis setup and maintenance procedures

## Success Criteria
- All PRs pass static analysis checks
- Type coverage >95% with mypy strict mode
- Zero high-severity security issues (bandit)
- Code quality score >9.0/10 (pylint)
- Analysis runs <2 minutes in CI
- Clear documentation for contributors
- No regressions in existing functionality

## Dependencies
- Pre-commit hooks setup (TASK015)
- CI/CD workflow enhancements

## Timeline
- Week 1: Tool installation and basic configuration
- Week 2: Pre-commit integration and CI workflows
- Week 3: Rule customization, testing, and documentation
