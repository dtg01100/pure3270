# TASK026: Structured Logging

## Objective
Implement structured logging with JSON formatting throughout the library, enabling better observability, debugging, and integration with log aggregation systems.

## Scope
- Replace print statements and basic logging with structured log entries
- JSON log formatting with consistent schema (timestamp, level, module, message, context)
- Protocol-specific log contexts (data stream details, negotiation state, screen state)
- Performance logging (operation timing, buffer sizes, network latency)
- Log level configuration for development/production
- Integration with existing exception handling
- Log rotation and size management for long-running sessions
- Documentation of logging schema and usage

## Implementation Steps
1. Install and configure structured logging library (structlog or similar)
2. Define logging schema and context processors
3. Refactor existing logging calls to structured format
4. Add protocol-specific log contexts (parse positions, byte sequences)
5. Implement performance monitoring and timing logs
6. Integrate with enhanced exception handling (TASK021)
7. Configure log levels and handlers for different environments
8. Set up log rotation and file management
9. Add unit tests for logging behavior
10. Document logging configuration and schema

## Success Criteria
- 100% of log messages are structured JSON
- Log performance overhead <5% of operation time
- Protocol debugging information actionable
- Exception logs include full context
- Configurable log levels without code changes
- Integration with log aggregation tools
- Clear documentation for log consumers

## Dependencies
- Enhanced exception handling (TASK021)

## Timeline
- Week 1: Logging infrastructure setup
- Week 2: Protocol and performance logging
- Week 3: Integration, testing, and documentation
