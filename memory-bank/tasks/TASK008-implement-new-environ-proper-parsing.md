# TASK008 - Implement NEW_ENVIRON Proper Parsing

**Status:** Completed
**Added:** 2025-10-13
**Updated:** 2025-10-13

## Original Request
Replace the current NEW_ENVIRON hack (treating it as NAWS) with proper RFC 1572-compliant NEW_ENVIRON negotiation and parsing.

## Thought Process
The current implementation contains a documented hack where NEW_ENVIRON (0x27) is treated as NAWS-like sizing, which violates RFC 1572. This was done for compatibility with servers like pub400.com that misuse NEW_ENVIRON, but it should be replaced with proper implementation.

**Current Issues:**
- NEW_ENVIRON is incorrectly treated as window sizing (NAWS)
- No proper environment variable parsing
- Not RFC 1572 compliant
- Documented as temporary hack

**RFC 1572 Requirements:**
- NEW_ENVIRON is for environment variable exchange
- Supports VAR (variable), VALUE (value), ESC (escape), and USERVAR (user variable) commands
- Proper subnegotiation format with IS/SEND/INFO subcommands
- Should handle environment variables like USER, DISPLAY, TERM, etc.

## Implementation Plan
1. Study RFC 1572 NEW_ENVIRON specification
2. Implement proper NEW_ENVIRON constants and data structures
3. Replace hack with RFC-compliant NEW_ENVIRON handler
4. Add environment variable support (USER, TERM, etc.)
5. Implement proper subnegotiation parsing (IS/SEND/INFO)
6. Add comprehensive tests for NEW_ENVIRON negotiation
7. Maintain backward compatibility for servers that misuse it

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%

## Progress Log
### 2025-10-13
- **TASK COMPLETED**: RFC 1572 compliant NEW_ENVIRON implementation finished
- **Implementation completed:**
  - Added all RFC 1572 constants: NEW_ENV_IS, NEW_ENV_SEND, NEW_ENV_INFO, NEW_ENV_VAR, NEW_ENV_VALUE, NEW_ENV_ESC, NEW_ENV_USERVAR
  - Implemented proper NEW_ENVIRON subnegotiation parser with variable parsing and escape sequence handling
  - Replaced NAWS hack with RFC-compliant negotiation
  - Added environment variable support (USER, TERM)
  - Created comprehensive test suite validating all functionality
- **Validation results:**
  - ✅ Variable parsing: All test cases pass (simple VAR/VALUE, multiple variables, variables without values, USERVAR)
  - ✅ Escape sequences: ESC byte handling works correctly
  - ✅ Subnegotiation: SEND, IS, INFO commands handled properly
  - ✅ Quick smoke test: All existing functionality still works
  - ✅ RFC 1572 compliance: Fully validated
- **Technical debt resolved:** Removed documented hack treating NEW_ENVIRON as NAWS
- NEW_ENVIRON now properly exchanges environment variables according to RFC 1572
