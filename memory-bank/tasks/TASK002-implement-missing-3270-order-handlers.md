# [TASK002] Implement missing 3270 order handlers

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** 2025-09-12  
**Updated:** 2025-09-12

## Original Request
Resolve test failures by implementing missing methods (e.g., _handle_eoa, _handle_aid) and fixing assertions (e.g., update regex patterns).

## Thought Process
Test failures indicate that certain 3270 order handlers are not implemented in DataStreamParser. When the parser encounters these orders, it raises AttributeError because the handler methods don't exist. Need to implement these methods following the established patterns in the codebase.

Key considerations:
- Handlers should follow the naming convention _handle_<order_name>
- They should accept appropriate parameters (typically order byte and data stream)
- Basic implementations can log the order and continue parsing
- Some handlers may need more complex logic for proper 3270 emulation

## Implementation Plan
1. Run tests to identify specific missing handler methods
2. Review 3270 order specifications for correct behavior
3. Implement stub handlers with logging for unknown/missing orders
4. Update test assertions to match new implementations
5. Verify tests pass after implementation

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100% Complete

### Subtasks
| ID | Description | Status | Updated | Notes |
|----|-------------|--------|---------|-------|
| 2.1 | Identify missing handler methods from test failures | Completed | 2025-09-12 | Found _handle_aid, _handle_wcc, _handle_eoa issues |
| 2.2 | Implement _handle_aid method | Completed | 2025-09-12 | Method existed, fixed dispatch to pass AID value |
| 2.3 | Implement _handle_eoa method | Completed | 2025-09-12 | Method existed, dispatch working |
| 2.4 | Fix _handle_wcc method dispatch | Completed | 2025-09-12 | Updated dispatch to pass WCC byte |
| 2.5 | Implement other missing handlers | Completed | 2025-09-12 | Added build_printer_status_sf and build_soh_message to DataStreamSender |
| 2.6 | Fix import errors in tests | Completed | 2025-09-12 | Fixed BINARY to TELOPT_BINARY in test imports |

## Progress Log
### 2025-09-12
- Identified that _handle_aid and _handle_wcc methods existed but dispatch wasn't passing parameters
- Fixed dispatch logic to read WCC byte and AID value from data stream
- Verified AID and WCC parsing tests now pass
- Added build_printer_status_sf and build_soh_message methods to DataStreamSender
- Fixed BINARY import to TELOPT_BINARY in test files
### 2025-09-12 (finalized)
- Completed implementation/fixes for missing 3270 order handlers and updated tests/mocks accordingly
- Task marked as completed and memory bank updated
