# [TASK002] Implement missing 3270 order handlers

**Status:** In Progress  
**Added:** 2025-09-12  
**Updated:** 2025-09-12

## Original Request
Resolve test failures by implementing missing methods (e.g., _handle_eoa, _handle_aid) and fixing assertions (e.g., update regex patterns).

## Thought Process
Test failures indicate that certain 3270 order handlers are not implemented in DataStreamParser. When the parser encounters these orders, it raises AttributeError because the handler methods don't exist. Need to implement these methods following the established patterns in the codebase.

Key considerations:
- Handlers should follow the naming convention _handle_<order_name>
- They should accept appropriate parameters (typically order byte and data stream)
- Basic implementations can log the order and continue parsing
- Some handlers may need more complex logic for proper 3270 emulation

## Implementation Plan
1. Run tests to identify specific missing handler methods
2. Review 3270 order specifications for correct behavior
3. Implement stub handlers with logging for unknown/missing orders
4. Update test assertions to match new implementations
5. Verify tests pass after implementation

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** In Progress - 10% Complete
