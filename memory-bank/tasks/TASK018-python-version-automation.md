# TASK018: Automated Python Version Regression Detection

## Objective
Set up workflows to detect and report regressions across Python versions.

## Requirements
- Monitor new Python releases.
- Run tests on supported versions (3.8+).
- Auto-create issues/PRs for failures.

## Implementation Steps
1. Update .github/workflows/python-regression.yml to test multiple Pythons via matrix.
2. Add script to check latest Python releases (using API or RSS).
3. Integrate with GitHub Actions: trigger on release, report to issues.
4. Use pytest-xdist for parallel testing.
5. Document supported versions in python_version_automation.md.

## Success Metrics
- Tests run on 3.8-3.13+ automatically.
- Regression issues created within 24h of new release.
- 100% version coverage.

## Dependencies
- Cross-version testing (TASK019)
