# TASK007 - Persist current state documentation

**Status:** Completed
**Added:** 2025-09-23
**Updated:** 2025-09-23

## Original Request
User requested to "save anything" that would help resume the effort later. Goal: Persist full architectural, protocol, progress, and roadmap context so future sessions can continue without rediscovery.

## Thought Process
A comprehensive memory bank is required because the agent's memory resets. We need structured documents capturing: project goals (drop-in p3270 replacement), protocol negotiation state (TTYPE fix, NEW_ENVIRON workaround), hybrid ASCII/3270 handling decisions, pending tasks (snapshot parity, licensing, API audit), and known limitations (no full NEW_ENVIRON parser, missing licensing artifacts). This ensures immediate productivity upon resumption.

## Implementation Plan
- Create memory-bank core files (projectbrief, productContext, systemPatterns, techContext, activeContext, progress)
- Populate each with distilled, actionable details (not verbose narrative)
- Add tasks index and this task file
- Enumerate pending tasks with clear acceptance criteria
- Validate quick_test passes post-documentation (sanity)

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%

## Acceptance Criteria for Pending Tasks (Referenced)
- TASK002 Screen Parity Scaffold: Tool outputs normalized snapshot file; comparison detects drift; integration script exits non-zero on mismatch.
- TASK003 API Compatibility: Enumerated method list vs p3270; missing methods flagged in test; smoke script prints summary.
- TASK004 Licensing: THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md with s3270/x3270 copyright + license notices; README references file.
- TASK005 Porting Guidelines: Document outlining attribution steps, minimal change import policy, RFC-first rule.
- TASK006 Attribution Scaffolding: Constant template + helper that injects block comment; unit test asserts presence.

## Progress Log
### 2025-09-23
- Created memory-bank core documentation files capturing architecture & state.
- Added tasks index with pending roadmap items.
- Drafted acceptance criteria for future tasks.
- Prepared this task tracking file.

### 2025-09-23 (Completion)
- Reviewed acceptance criteria; no changes needed.
- Executed quick_test.py successfully (all sections PASS) validating no regressions introduced by documentation.
- Marked all remaining subtasks complete and closed TASK007.

### Next Steps
- Complete acceptance criteria section polish (subtask 1.4).
- Run quick_test.py (subtask 1.5).
- Mark task complete after review (subtask 1.6).
