# TASK020: Comprehensive Cross-Version Testing Matrix

## Objective
Establish a full testing matrix across Python versions and OS.

## Requirements
- Test Python 3.8-3.13 on Linux, macOS, Windows.
- Include unit, integration, property tests.
- Report coverage and pass rates per version.

## Implementation Steps
1. Expand .github/workflows/comprehensive-python-testing.yml with OS matrix.
2. Use tox or pytest matrix for local runs.
3. Generate reports with badges in README.md.
4. Pin dependencies per version if needed.
5. Automate matrix updates on Python releases.

## Success Metrics
- 100% pass rate on supported versions.
- Matrix covers all major OS/Python combos.
- Automated reporting dashboard.

## Dependencies
- Property-based testing (TASK014)
- Static analysis (TASK013)
