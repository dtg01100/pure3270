# TASK029: Cross-Version Testing Matrix

## Objective
Establish comprehensive testing across multiple Python versions to ensure compatibility, including unit, integration, and performance tests with automated matrix generation and reporting.

## Scope
- Dynamic test matrix for Python 3.8-3.13+
- Unit test compatibility across versions
- Integration test stability (protocol, macro execution)
- Performance benchmarks per version
- Coverage reporting per Python version
- Automated matrix expansion for new releases
- Failure isolation and version-specific debugging
- Compatibility sharding for CI efficiency

## Implementation Steps
1. Create testing matrix configuration (versions, test types)
2. Set up multi-version testing in CI workflows
3. Implement unit test version compatibility
4. Add integration test cross-version validation
5. Develop performance benchmarking suite
6. Create coverage reporting per version
7. Set up automated matrix updates for new Python releases
8. Implement failure isolation and debugging tools
9. Optimize CI sharding for parallel version testing
10. Document testing matrix maintenance and expansion

## Success Criteria
- Tests run successfully on all supported Python versions
- Coverage >90% across all versions
- Performance regressions detected within 1% variance
- CI execution time <20 minutes for full matrix
- Automated updates for new Python releases
- Clear failure isolation and debugging capabilities
- Version-specific test optimization

## Dependencies
- Python version automation (TASK027)
- Property-based testing (TASK023)

## Timeline
- Week 1: Matrix setup and unit test compatibility
- Week 2: Integration and performance testing
- Week 3: Coverage, optimization, and documentation
