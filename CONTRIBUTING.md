# Contributing to Pure3270

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Before you start, please note:

## Macro DSL Policy (Permanent)

Macro scripting/DSL was removed from Pure3270 and will not be reintroduced.

- Do not submit PRs that add or reintroduce a macro DSL, `execute_macro`, `load_macro`, or `MacroError`.
- The CI includes a guard (`tools/forbid_macros.py`) that fails if macro DSL code or references are added back.
- Discussions and issues proposing macro DSL will be closed. Focus contributions on protocol compliance, emulation fidelity, and API quality.

## How to contribute

1. Open an issue describing the bug/feature.
2. Create a feature branch from the latest `main`.
3. Add tests for your change when practical.
4. Run local CI: `./ci.sh` (or `python run_full_ci.py --fast`).
5. **Code formatting is automatic**: Pre-commit hooks will auto-format and create formatting commits.
6. Submit a PR with a clear description and rationale.

## Code style

- Python 3.10+
- Standard library only for runtime; optional dev tools for tests/linting.
- **Formatting is automatic**: `black` and `isort` are applied automatically by pre-commit hooks.
- Follow RFCs for TN3270/TN3270E and Telnet behavior.

## Development Workflow

### Setup
```bash
# Install with development dependencies
pip install -e .[test]

# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

### Making Changes
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/my-feature

# Make your changes
# ... edit files ...

# Commit (auto-formatting will be applied)
git add .
git commit -m "Add my feature"
# âœ… Pre-commit hooks auto-format and create commits as needed

# Run tests
python quick_test.py
./ci.sh  # Full CI suite
```

### Manual Commands (if needed)
```bash
# Manual formatting (usually not needed)
black .
isort . --profile=black

# Manual pre-commit run
./pre-commit.sh --all-files

# Run specific hooks
./pre-commit.sh black isort flake8
```
