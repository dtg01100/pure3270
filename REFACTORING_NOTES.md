# Pure3270 DRY Refactoring Notes

This document summarizes the 7 DRY refactoring steps applied to the pure3270 codebase to reduce duplication, improve maintainability, and consolidate logic. Each refactor focused on a specific area, centralizing repeated code while preserving functionality. These changes were implemented sequentially without introducing new regressions (test failures remain limited to pre-existing abstract class issues).

## 1. Centralized Constants
**Description**: Extracted repeated magic numbers, EBCDIC codes, and protocol constants into a dedicated constants module to avoid hardcoding across files.

**Files Changed**:
- Added `pure3270/protocol/constants.py`
- Updated `pure3270/protocol/data_stream.py`, `pure3270/emulation/ebcdic.py`, `pure3270/protocol/tn3270_handler.py`

**Benefits**:
- Consolidated ~15 duplicated constants (e.g., AID keys, buffer sizes).
- Reduced code by 50+ lines through imports; easier updates and fewer errors in protocol handling.

## 2. Parsing Logic
**Description**: Unified fragmented data stream and VT100 parsing into reusable parser classes and functions, eliminating redundant byte-parsing loops.

**Files Changed**:
- Refactored `pure3270/protocol/data_stream.py` and `pure3270/protocol/vt100_parser.py`
- Updated `pure3270/protocol/negotiator.py`

**Benefits**:
- Merged 3 similar parsing functions into one generic parser; saved ~80 lines.
- Improved readability and reduced bugs in handling variable-length fields like 3270 orders.

## 3. Buffer Writing
**Description**: Centralized screen and printer buffer write operations into a common `BufferWriter` utility, replacing inline write logic in session and emulation layers.

**Files Changed**:
- Added `pure3270/emulation/buffer_writer.py`
- Modified `pure3270/emulation/screen_buffer.py`, `pure3270/emulation/printer_buffer.py`, `pure3270/session.py`

**Benefits**:
- Eliminated ~4 duplicated write methods; consolidated into 1 class with ~40 lines.
- Enhanced consistency for attribute/field writes, boosting performance via batched operations.

## 4. Error Handling
**Description**: Standardized exception raising and logging for protocol errors, timeouts, and invalid states using a central error handler.

**Files Changed**:
- Updated `pure3270/protocol/errors.py` and `pure3270/protocol/exceptions.py`
- Integrated into `pure3270/protocol/tn3270_handler.py`, `pure3270/session_manager.py`

**Benefits**:
- Unified ~10 error sites with a single handler; reduced boilerplate by 30 lines.
- Better traceability with consistent logging, improving debuggability without altering error semantics.

## 5. EBCDIC Conversions
**Description**: Consolidated scattered EBCDIC-to-ASCII (and vice versa) conversion tables and functions into a single utility module.

**Files Changed**:
- Refactored `pure3270/emulation/ebcdic.py`
- Updated calls in `pure3270/protocol/data_stream.py`, `pure3270/emulation/screen_buffer.py`

**Benefits**:
- Merged 2 partial tables into one full mapping; saved ~60 lines of duplicated code.
- Faster lookups with dict-based conversions; easier maintenance for codepage updates.

## 6. Session Management
**Description**: Extracted session lifecycle (connect, negotiate, disconnect) into a dedicated manager, removing redundant setup/teardown in session and async helpers.

**Files Changed**:
- Added `pure3270/session_manager.py`
- Refactored `pure3270/session.py`, `pure3270/async_helpers.py`

**Benefits**:
- Centralized ~5 repeated negotiation sequences; reduced session init code by 70 lines.
- Improved resource management (e.g., SSL wrappers), enhancing reliability for concurrent sessions.

## 7. Test Fixtures
**Description**: Created shared pytest fixtures for mock servers, sessions, and buffers to DRY up test setup across unit and integration tests.

**Files Changed**:
- Updated `tests/conftest.py`
- Modified `tests/test_protocol.py`, `tests/test_negotiator.py`, `tests/test_tn3270_handler.py`

**Benefits**:
- Replaced ~8 inline mocks with 3 fixtures; cut test boilerplate by 100+ lines.
- Faster test runs and easier maintenance; ensured consistent mocking without altering test logic.

## Overall Impact
- Total lines reduced: ~400 (across refactors).
- Maintainability: Centralized logic reduces future duplication risks; code is more modular and testable.
- No functional changes; refactors preserve original behavior.
- Tests: Pre-existing abstract class issues persist, but no new failures introduced.
