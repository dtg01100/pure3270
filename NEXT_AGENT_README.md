# Pure3270 Project - Handoff Summary

## Current Status

The project has been significantly improved with most critical issues resolved:

- **Test failures reduced from 35 to 5**
- **All flake8 code quality issues fixed (0 remaining)**
- **API consistency achieved between README and implementation**
- **Backward compatibility maintained**

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Critical Bug Fixes
- Fixed undefined variables in `examples/example_standalone.py`
- Resolved failing protocol tests by properly mocking IAC sequences
- Made Session and AsyncSession constructors API-consistent with README
- Improved error handling in protocol utilities and negotiator
- Fixed session tests requiring connection by mocking _connected property
- Corrected screen buffer initialization to spaces instead of zeros
- Fixed decorator issues in resource loading tests

### 2. Code Quality Improvements
- Eliminated all flake8 warnings and errors
- Improved test reliability and reduced runtime warnings
- Better separation of concerns in protocol handling
- Enhanced documentation and comments

## Remaining Issues (5 failing tests)

### 1. Field Detection Logic
**Test**: `test_write_char_out_of_bounds` in `test_emulation.py`
**Issue**: Complex field boundary detection logic needs refinement
**Location**: `pure3270/emulation/screen_buffer.py` - `_detect_fields()` method

### 2. Printer Session Detection
**Test**: `test_is_printer_session_active` in `test_tn3270_handler.py`
**Issue**: Printer session detection based on LU name patterns not working correctly
**Location**: `pure3270/protocol/negotiator.py` - `is_printer_session_active()` method

### 3. Resource Loading Test Edge Cases
**Tests**: 
- `test_load_resource_definitions_invalid_resource`
- `test_load_resource_definitions_integration_macro`
- `test_insert_action`

**Issues**:
- Missing `logger` attribute mocking in session tests
- Macro execution not properly calling `load_resource_definitions`
- Color mode logic needs adjustment for model "3279"

## Recommended Next Steps

### For Field Detection Issue
1. Review the `_detect_fields()` method logic in `screen_buffer.py`
2. The method may need to handle edge cases in field boundary detection
3. Consider adding more comprehensive test cases for complex field scenarios

### For Printer Session Issue
1. Check the `is_printer_session_active()` method in `negotiator.py`
2. Verify LU name pattern matching logic for "LTR" and "PTR" substrings
3. Ensure the negotiator's `lu_name` property is being set correctly during tests

### For Resource Loading Issues
1. Add a `logger` property to the AsyncSession class or mock it properly in tests
2. Review the macro execution logic to ensure `LoadResource` commands call the method
3. Fix the color mode logic to properly handle model "3279" as a color model

## Project Context

This is a pure Python 3270 terminal emulator designed to replace the external `s3270` binary dependency in the `p3270` library. The project provides both synchronous and asynchronous APIs with full 3270 protocol support including TN3270 and TN3270E.

The work completed in this session has made the project much more stable and testable while maintaining full API compatibility with the documented interface.
