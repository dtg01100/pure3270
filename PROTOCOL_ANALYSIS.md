## Conclusion

Pure3270 provides a solid foundation for TN3270/TN3270E protocol implementation with approximately 85% RFC compliance. While it successfully handles basic terminal emulation and core protocol features, there are significant gaps in advanced functionality, particularly in printer emulation, device type negotiation, and TN3270E header processing.

The implementation successfully serves its primary purpose of replacing the external s3270 binary dependency in p3270 setups, providing a pure Python alternative. However, for applications requiring full RFC compliance or advanced 3270 features, additional development work would be needed to bridge the gaps identified in this analysis.

The modular architecture and clean Python implementation provide a good foundation for future enhancements, making it a viable option for Python-based 3270 terminal emulation projects.
