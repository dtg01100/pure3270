# Create high‑quality AGENTS.md file

## What is AGENTS.md?

AGENTS.md is a
Markdown file that serves as a "README for agents" - a dedicated, predictable place
to provide context and instructions to help AI coding agents work on your
project. It complements README.md by containing detailed technical context that coding
agents need but might clutter a human-focused README.
