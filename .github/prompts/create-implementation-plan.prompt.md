# Create Implementation Plan

## Primary Directive

Your
goal is to create a new implementation plan file for `${input:PlanPurpose}`. Your
output must be machine-readable, deterministic, and structured for autonomous
execution by other AI systems or humans.

## Execution Context

This prompt is
designed for AI-to-AI communication and automated processing. All instructions
must be interpreted literally and executed systematically without human
interpretation or clarification.

## Core Requirements

- Generate implementation plans
that are fully executable by AI agents or humans
- Use deterministic language with
zero ambiguity
- Structure all content for automated parsing and execution
-
Ensure complete self-containment with no external dependencies for
understanding
