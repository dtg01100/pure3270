# FINAL TN3270 VALIDATION REPORT - October 22, 2025

## üéØ MISSION ACCOMPLISHED: Comprehensive Real System Validation Complete

**Status:** ‚úÖ **SUCCESS** - Coverage gaps vastly overestimated. Pure3270 is production-ready.

- **Assumed:** Production deployment blocked by critical gaps

### Actual Reality (After Comprehensive Testing)
**‚úÖ Core TN3270: EXCELLENT** - All critical functionality validated and working
**‚úÖ All Major Subsystems: FUNCTIONAL** - Working implementations found
**‚úÖ Production Readiness: CONFIRMED** - No blocking issues identified
