"""Pure3270 pub400.com connectivity example.

Demonstrates using the high-level synchronous `Session` API to:
1. Connect to a public TN3270 host (pub400.com)
2. Send an Enter key
3. Read back the immediate screen buffer representation

NOTE: Public hosts may rate-limit or disconnect frequently; this
example is best-effort and intended for manual experimentation.
