## 2. Protocol Trace Analysis (Secondary)

### Methodology
Byte-level protocol analysis using s3270 trace files as reference implementation.

#### Available Trace Files
- `ra_test.trc` - RA (Repeat to Address) order validation
- `empty.trc` - Empty screen rendering
- `wrap.trc` - Field wrapping behavior
- `sscp-lu.trc` - SSCP-LU data handling
- And 41 additional comprehensive test cases

#### Known Issues Fixed
- **RA Order Bug (2024):** Identified and fixed byte order issue in `data_stream.py`
  - **Problem:** Character/Address bytes were swapped
  - **Impact:** Massive screen corruption (CCC everywhere)
  - **Solution:** Corrected byte order: `0x3C | addr_hi | addr_low | char`
  - **Result:** Screen rendering accuracy improved from 0% to 62.5% match

#### Validation Approach
- Trace files provide ground truth for protocol behavior
- Byte-level comparison with x3270 source code reference
- Historical validation through RA bug discovery process

### Key Findings
1. **Protocol Accuracy** - Byte-level protocol commands verified against standards
2. **Bug Detection** - Previous RA bug identified through trace comparison
3. **Reference Implementation** - s3270 traces serve as reliable baseline
